# coding problems

This is a set of my work regarding various coding challenges that I come across.

Also included in this are implementations of protocols and practice within specific domains.

## codingQuestions
Answers to coding questions asked on websites around the web:
(leetcode, boot.dev, etc)

Within this folder are divisions based on each programming language used.
Follow readme instructions within each language folder for instructions on 
building and executing things.

## datastructs
These are coding data abstract data structures.

The main purpose is to practice implementing a data structure and improve my
recollection of its structure or make it in multiple different languages and see
how I can improve an initial attempt.

## protocols
Implementing a protocol following papers online (IETF or otherwise)

## psql
Work with postgreSQL to touch on various pieces of SQL scripting.
This should probably just be "db" so that I can split into SQL and other
database organization, but whatever.

## scratch
Random files that don't fit into a category and are just testing briefly
